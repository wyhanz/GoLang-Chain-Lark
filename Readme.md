Welcome to GoLang-Chain-Lark! This repository is my personal exploration into the world of Golang, Langchain, and AI agents. Through this project, I've implemented a Lark Suite Robot🤖️ as a means to delve deeper into these topics. While it serves as a foundational starting point for further expansions and integrations, it's primarily a space for learning and experimentation.

## Features 🌟

- LLM Integration 🧠: As part of my study, I've integrated the llama2-chat-13b model via text-generation-inference. This has allowed me to experience firsthand the improvements in throughput and responsiveness over standard loading.

- Flexibility 🔄: The project is designed to easily switch between different models. This adaptability has been a great learning curve, showcasing the dynamic nature of Langchain.

- Advanced Parsing 📄✨: Beyond simple interactions, I've experimented with parsing capabilities. The robot can understand and parse the content of files sent by users, making it a more interactive and insightful study tool.

- User-Friendly Interactions 🤝: The current setup supports private chats with single round interactions, offering a glimpse into the potential of AI-driven conversations.

## Roadmap (To-Do) 🚀

- Dive into group chats and multi-round conversations 🗣️

- Explore support for additional file formats 📂

- Investigate integration with retrieval services like milvus 🔍

## Development Status 🛠️

This project is a continuous journey of learning and experimentation. While it's in the development stage, I'm always looking for new insights and avenues to explore within Golang, Langchain, and AI.
